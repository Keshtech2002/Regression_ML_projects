## Concepts mentioned here were learnt and utilized in this project

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Regression
- Regression analysis
- Linear Regression
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Residuals: Difference between predicted and actual values of the target variables
- Coefficients: Which predictor variables have most impact on the target variable
- Ordinary Least squares: OLS to estimate the regression coefficients and minimize the sum of squared residuals
- R-squared: Higher R-squared value indicates a better fit, determine how model fits the data
- Overfitting: Avoid overfitting with techniques such as cross-validation and regularization
- Regularization: L1, L2 regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model
- Gradient Descent: Optimize model parameters and improve the fit of the model
